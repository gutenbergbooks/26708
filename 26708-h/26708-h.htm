<h2>MIXED NOTIONS.</h2>

<h4>No. X.&mdash;THE BEHRING-SEA ARBITRATION.</h4>


<p class="center">(<i>Scene and Persons as usual.</i> <i>The Conversation has already begun.</i>)</p>

<p><i>First Well-informed Man</i> (<i>concluding a tirade</i>). &mdash;&mdash; so what I
want to know is this: are we or are we not to submit to the
Yankees? It's all very well talking about Chicago Exhibitions and
all that, but if they're going to capture our ships and prevent us
killing seals, why, the sooner we tell 'em to go to
blue blazes the better. And as for its being a
<i>mare clausum</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:150px;"><a href="images/217a.png"><img src="images/217a-150.png" width="150" height="255" alt="" /></a></div>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>interrupting</i>). Who was she? What's
she got to do with it?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> (<i>laughing vigorously</i>). Ha! ha!
that's a good 'un.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>nettled</i>). Oh, laugh away, laugh away.
That's you all over.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> My dear chap, I'm very sorry,
but I really couldn't help it. There's no woman
in the business at all. <i>Mare clausum</i> merely
means the place where they catch the seals, you
know; <i>mare</i>, Latin for sea.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Oh! I should have known that
directly, if you'd only pronounced it properly. But what does
<i>clausum</i> mean?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Well, of course, that means&mdash;well, a clause, don't
you know. It's in the treaty.</p>

<p><i>Average Man</i> (<i>looking up from his paper</i>). It used to be the Latin
for "closed," but I suppose it's altered now.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> (<i>incredulously</i>). It can't mean that, anyhow.
Who ever heard of a closed sea, I should like to know?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> (<i>hazarding a suggestion</i>). It <i>might</i> mean a
harbour,
you know, or something of that sort.</p>

<p><i>Average Man.</i> I daresay it <i>might</i> mean that, but it doesn't happen
to be a harbour (<i>relapses into paper</i>).</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Oh, well, I only made the suggestion.
<span style="float: right">[<i>A pause.</i></span></p>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;"><i>Inquirer.</i> But what are they arbitrating about in Paris? It says
(<i>reading from newspaper</i>) "When Mr. <span class="sc">Carter</span>, the United States
Counsel, had concluded his speech, he was complimented by the
President, the Baron <span class="sc">de Courcel</span>, who told him he had spoken on
behalf of humanity." I thought old <span class="sc">Carnot</span> was President of the
French Republic.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> So he is.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i>. But this paper says Baron <span class="sc">de Courcel</span> is President.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Oh, I suppose that's one of <span class="sc">Carnot</span>'s titles,
All these blessed foreigners are Barons, or something of that sort.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Ah, I suppose that must be it. But what have the
French got to do with the Behring Sea? I thought it was all
between us and the Yankees.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> So it is&mdash;but the French are arbitrating. That's
how they come into the business. I can't say, personally, I like
these arbitrations. We're always arbitrating now, and giving
everything away. If we think we're right, why can't we say so,
and stick to it, and let the French, and the Yankees, and the
Russians, and all the rest of 'em, take it from us, if they can?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Take what from us?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Why, whatever it happens to be, the Behring
Sea, or anything else. We're so deuced afraid of everybody now,
we never show fight; it's perfectly sickening. But of course you
can't expect anything else from old <span class="sc">Gladstone</span>.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> That's right&mdash;shove it all on to old <span class="sc">Gladstone</span>.
But you're wrong this time. It was <span class="sc">Jo Chamberlain</span>, one of your
own blessed Unionists, that you're so proud of, who arranged this
arbitration.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> I know that, my dear boy; but <span class="sc">Chamberlain</span>
was a Radical then; so where are you now?<span style="float: right">[<i>A pause.</i></span></p>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;"><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>who has continued his reading, suddenly, with a puzzled
air</i>). I say, you know, this is too much of a good thing, bringing the
Russians into the business. It says&mdash;(<i>reads</i>)&mdash;"documents were
submitted, on behalf of the United States, to prove that Russia had
never abandoned her sovereign rights in the manner suggested by
Great Britain." How, on earth, does Russia manage to crop up
everywhere? And where is this confounded Behring Sea?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> (<i>vaguely</i>). It's somewhere in America, or
Newfoundland, or thereabouts.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> But how about Russia?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Oh, Russia shoves her oar in whenever we get
into a difficulty of any kind anywhere.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>persisting</i>). Yes&mdash;but how can she have any "sovereign
rights" in America?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> (<i>haughtily, but evasively</i>). My dear fellow, if
you had followed the thing properly, you wouldn't ask the question.
There's no time now to explain it all to you, as it's very complicated,
and goes back a long way. But you may take it from me
that Russia has got certain rights, and that she means to make
things as disagreeable for us as she can.<span style="float: right">[<i>A pause.</i></span></p>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;"><i>Inquirer.</i> It's rather a rum start, isn't it? sending out Sir
<span class="sc">Charles Russell</span> and Sir <span class="sc">Richard Webster</span>. They're on opposite
sides of politics.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> That's just why they send 'em. <span class="sc">Russell</span> has
got to put the Liberal view, and <span class="sc">Webster</span> the Conservative.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Of course, of course; I never thought of that. By the
way, have you ever seen a seal?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> They've got one at the Zoo. Catches
fish, and kisses the keeper, and all that sort of game.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> What, that big beast that looks as if it was made of
india-rubber, with long whiskers and a sort of fish-tail?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> That's it.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>with profound disgust</i>). Well, I <i>am</i> blessed! Is
<i>that</i> all
they're jawing about?<span style="float: right">[<i>Terminus.</i></span></p>

<h3>IN MEMORIAM&mdash;"THE DEVIL'S OWN."</h3>

<blockquote><p>
["Notwithstanding the efforts made by the Inns of Court Rifles, supported
by the Authorities of the Inns, to increase the strength of the corps, the
additional enrolments lately made have been judged by the War Office not
sufficient to warrant the continued maintenance of the corps as an independent
battalion; and orders have been given for its reduction from six to four
companies, for the withdrawal of the Adjutant, and for the attachment of the
corps to the 4th Middlesex Rifles."&mdash;<i>Daily Paper.</i>]
</p></blockquote>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Oh, how bright were the days when we all of us saw</p>
<p>In their martial equipment the limbs of the Law.</p>
<p>With their helmets and rifles, and pouches complete,</p>
<p>(May I quote from the ladies), they "really looked sweet."</p>
<p>The Colonel, the Major, and all their attendants,</p>
<p>Appeared not as counsel, since all were defendants;</p>
<p>And no soldierly spirit could equal the Bar's,</p>

<p>No more shall they charm us; harsh Fate with her shears</p>
<p>Has severed the thread of the Law's Volunteers.</p>
<p>And, whatever the cause was, 'twas certainly true</p>
<p>That these fee-less defenders at last were too few.</p>
<p>So now they're absorbed, and, no longer the same,</p>
<p>They lose by attachment their being and name.</p>
<p>And the old Devil's Own, from their discipline loosed,</p>
<p>Have gone to their owner; <i>i.e.</i>, they're <i>re-duced</i>.</p>

<h3>ENGLISH AS SHE IS SPOKE.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>In the House and out of it.</i>)</p>

<p>The Parliamentary Committee appointed to consider the best mode
of reporting in the House, have decided that it will be advisable to
allow Members to have an opportunity of revising their speeches after
they have been "taken down" verbatim. The result of this suggestion
will probably be as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:150px;"><a href="images/217b.png"><img src="images/217b-150.png" width="150" height="321" alt="'Spoke? Rather!'" /></a>
<p class="center">"Spoke? Rather!"</p></div>

<h3>MR. SYMPLE-STUTTER'S SPEECH.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Verbatim Report.</i>)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Speaker</span>, Sir, What I mean to say, I
venture to think is that the British Empire&mdash;yes
Sir&mdash;that is what I venture to think, and
<i>I</i> am a young Member. For I do not believe&mdash;no
not now&mdash;or in fact, when otherwise. For
envy and malice are together. I venture to
think that sometimes the British Empire. Yes
Sir, for the enemies are at our gates with the
past and the future. When the sun sinks&mdash;not
that it follows&mdash;at least so I venture to
think. You may believe me, Sir, that it is
farthest from my thoughts when the British
Empire and the sinking sun which I venture to
think is&mdash;in point of fact the setting sun, and
I venture to think the British Empire, and that
is I venture to think was my proposal in the past&mdash;which
has the terrors of the present from generation to generation.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Revised Report.</i>)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Speaker</span>, Sir, at a time like the present&mdash;when the enemies of
the Empire are clamouring at our gates, when envy walks hand-in-hand
with malice, and our fate is in our own hands&mdash;we should be
bold and resolute. It is not for a young Member like myself to
point out the course that we should pursue, but I venture to think
that, by ignoring the terrors of the past with the courage of the
present, we shall avert the dangers of the future. It has been said&mdash;and
truly said&mdash;that the sun never sets upon the British Empire.
Let us believe in that sun, and find in its rays an earnest of that
glory which was the birthright of our ancestors, and which, should
be the birthright of our descendants from generation to generation.</p>

<h3>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Extracted From the Diary of Toby, M.P.</span></p>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday Night May 1.</i>&mdash;Demonstrated in
Debate on Second Reading Home-Rule Bill that House may talk and
talk through twelve long nights, and not affect single vote&mdash;not even
<span class="sc">Saunders's</span>. To-night shown how a single speech may cause to
collapse what was expected and intended to be big Debate. It was
Mr. G. performed the miracle. Looked in at House on his way
from Downing Street, where he had received deputation on Eight
Hours Question, and delivered important speech. That might have
served as day's work for ordinary man, Mr. G., not to put too fine
a point upon it, is not ordinary man. Being here, sat listening to
<span class="sc">Dilke</span> with close attention. <span class="sc">Dilke</span> thinks time has come to
evacuate
Egypt. Stated his case in luminous speech; sustained his reputation
of knowing more about Egyptian Question than most men
except perhaps <span class="sc">Tommy Bowles</span>.</p>

<p>Mr. G. made no outward and visible sign of intention to follow;
took no notes, and sometimes, as he sat with drooping arms and
closed eyes, seemed to sleep. <span class="sc">Dilke</span> done and down, he sat bolt
upright, looked round with almost startled air, "Well, really," he
seemed to be saying to himself, "since I am here, and no one else
is disposed to follow, I might as well say a few words."</p>

<p>Spoke for half an hour, without
reference to a note, and without faltering
for a word. Preserved throughout
that studious assumption of having
accidentally looked in which marked
his appearance at table. Evidently
desired to minimise as much as possible
importance of occasion. Subject
broached, he was, possibly, expected
to say something; certainly not going
to make a speech, much less deliver
oration. Carried out this subtle fancy
to such extent that, pitching voice on
low conversational tone, sometimes
difficult to catch full length of sentences.
This added to impressiveness
of scene. Crowded House sitting
breathless; Members opposite leaning
forward lest they might miss a phrase.
Everyone conscious that at the door
also listening were jealous France, the
wily Turk, the interested Egyptian,
the not entirely disinterested <span class="sc">Czar</span>,
and the other Great Powers concerned
for peace of Europe.</p>

<p>Mr. G., for all his affectation of unpremeditation,
evidently had in mind
these listeners at the door. To their
shadowy presence was, for him, added
consciousness of keen eyes watching
him from all quarters of the House;
some of his friends waiting for sign of
readiness to quit Egypt; the Opposition
ready to catch at any token of tendency to scuttle. Occasional
passages he delivered at rapid rate; but you could see him weighing
every word with due consideration of these manifold and conflicting
interests and influences.</p>

<p>When he sat down, there was consciousness that the massive
figure of important Debate that had loomed over House whilst
<span class="sc">Dilke</span> was speaking had melted away. <span class="sc">Jokim</span> and <span class="sc">Gorst</span>
had intended
to speak from Front Bench; great authorities on Foreign
Policy in other parts of House had proposed to say something, more
or less soothing. Mr. G. had left nothing for anyone to say, unless
it were <span class="sc">Alpheus Cleophas</span>, and the <span class="sc">Talented Tommy</span>, who,
sitting immediately opposite the <span class="sc">Premier</span>, had, whilst he spoke,
taken voluminous notes, only occasionally withdrawing eyes from
manuscript to fix them with look of calm distrust upon the aged and
unconscious statesman.</p>

<p>"I always like, when I look in," said <span class="sc">Marjoribanks</span>, smiling
beneficently from the Bar, "to find <span class="sc">Tommy</span> in his place, taking notes.
Gives one a sense of security. I feel, when I'm in the Lobby,
looking after things, it's all right in the House. <span class="sc">Browning</span> said
something of that sort. Don't remember exactly how it ran;
something in this way:</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 0;">A PATRON OF OLD CHINA.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: -1em;">(<i>Vide "China Bowles Collection."</i>)</p></div>

<div class="poem" style="margin-top: -0.5em;">  <div class="stanza">
<p><span class="sc">Tommy Bowles</span> is in his place;</p>
<p>It's all right with the Empire."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Mr. G. excelled himself.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Seven-leagued Boots not needed by <span class="sc">Talented Tommy</span>.
He moves about universe with ease and grace, unmindful of mountains,
regardless of ravines, reckless of rivers, oblivious of oceans.
Last night, Forty Centuries looked down upon him whilst he showed
how, in Egypt, Mr. G. is wrong, and <span class="sc">Dilke</span>, who criticised Ministerial
policy, is not right. To-night he stands on the Roof of the World,
a solitary, colossal figure upright on the lone Pamirs. His attitude
is of manifold mien. Defiant of Russia, suspicious of <span class="sc">Rosebery</span>,
patronising towards Afghanistan, he takes young China familiarly
by the elbow, and bids it be of good cheer, for <span class="sc">Tommy Bowles</span> is its
friend. Since <span class="sc">Napoleon</span> crossed the Alps, and was caught in the
act by the brush of the painter, the world has not seen so moving a
picture as <span class="sc">Tommy</span> throned on the grandly desolate Pamirs.</p>

<p>House almost empty whilst the Talented One discoursed on
the subject. Mr. G., who misses nothing, happily in his place,
listening with eager hand at ear whilst <span class="sc">Tommy</span> spoke familiarly
of Asiatic rivers and mountains, not one with name of less
than five syllables. <span class="sc">Dicky Temple</span>, who really knows something
about this mysterious region, looked on in blank amazement at
<span class="sc">Tommy's</span> erudition. <span class="sc">Edward Grey</span>, who would presently have to
answer this damaging attack, tried to seem indifferent. But his
young cheek paled when <span class="sc">Tommy</span> put his ruthless finger on that
Foreign Office dispatch, out of which a line of print had been
dropped. This a Machiavellian device that had hitherto escaped
detection. <span class="sc">Tommy's</span> falcon eye had noted it, his relentless foot had
followed up the tracks, and he had discovered, on reference to the
original, that the criminally-deleted line of print embodied a reference
to the Oxus. That was all. "Only the Oxus!" he said, with
withering sarcasm. Then changing
his tone and manner, he shook a minatory
forefinger at the shrinking form of
the <span class="sc">Premier</span>, and cried aloud, in voice
strengthened with long warring with
the winds on the Pamirs: "Sir, the
stream of the Oxus has been entirely
omitted from this paragraph."</p>

<p>"Poor Mr. G.!" said <span class="sc">W. J. Lowther</span>,
present in his capacity as Ex-Under-Secretary
for Foreign Affairs.
"What with <span class="sc">Labby</span> one night and
<span class="sc">Tommy Bowles</span> the next, he has a sad
time of it."</p>

<p>"Yes," said <span class="sc">Plunket</span>, sole companion
on the Front Bench. "It's a
hard fate for a Prime Minister to stand
between L. and <span class="sc">Tommy</span>."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Miscellaneous talk
on going into Committee of Supply.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Little difficulty arisen
in connection with Budget. <span class="sc">Squire</span>
faced by deficit of million and half.
This he met by expedient that will be
historical, as affording <span class="sc">Jokim</span> opportunity
for a popular jape. The <span class="sc">Squire</span>
has dropped his penny in the slot, in
accordance with directions, pulls out
the drawer, and finds there is something
more than the sum necessary to
balance the year's account. That is
all very well; but there are some
amateur <span class="sc">Chancellors</span> of the <span class="sc">Exchequer</span>
who would do great things with the odd &pound;20,000 or &pound;30,000
which remains as surplus. <span class="sc">Clark</span> wants Graduated Income-tax;
<span class="sc">Bartley</span> proposes Abatement on Incomes below &pound;200; whilst
<span class="sc">Grant Lawson</span> would let farmers off with half the proposed increase.
Best of all is, <span class="sc">Alpheus Cleophas</span>, who would straightway abolish
the tax on tea. The keen insight of <span class="sc">Alpheus</span> notes the little
difficulty about the deficit.</p>

<p>"The <span class="sc">Chancellor</span> of the <span class="sc">Exchequer</span>," he observed, in his most
judicial manner, "may ask me to suggest another source of
revenue." The <span class="sc">Squire</span> pricked up his ears; the Committee sat
attentive. If <span class="sc">Alpheus Cleophas</span> had given his great mind to
consideration
of the subject, it might be regarded as settled. All
waited for his next utterances. "That," he continued, in steely tones,
"is the <span class="sc">Chancellor</span> of the <span class="sc">Exchequer's</span> business. Mine is to
carry
out the Newcastle Programme." <span class="sc">Alpheus Cleophas</span> thereupon
resumed his seat, leaving the <span class="sc">Squire</span> gloomily facing the dead wall
of his deficit.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Budget Bill passed report stage.</p>

<p><i>Friday Night.</i>&mdash;Some young bloods below Gangway, on Ministerial
side, in distinctly low spirits. On Tuesday night, stage of
Budget Bill being taken, with ten minutes to spare, <span class="sc">Asquith</span>
nimbly moved reference of Employers' Liability Bill to Grand Committee.
Opposition, who want it referred to Select Committee, were
under impression Mr. G. had promised discussion should not be
taken till Thursday or Friday. Last night <span class="sc">Chamberlain</span> protested
that they had been betrayed, and deceived. Young bloods below
Gangway disposed to chuckle over this spectacle. Mr. G., on contrary,
takes it seriously to heart. Having got Bill referred to Grand
Committee, positively agrees to rescind Order, and begin all over
again.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>[pg 221]</span>

<p>"It's very seldom," says the <span class="sc">Sage of
Queen Anne's Gate</span>, in most melancholy
mood, "that our side show themselves capable
of doing a smart thing. When, by chance,
it is accomplished, Mr. G. comes along, and
coolly undoes it."</p>

<p>To-day, nearly two hours spent in discussing
question; Bill, eventually, remitted
to Grand Committee, as it had been left at
midnight on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"Shan't play!" cries <span class="sc">Chamberlain</span>.
"All very well for you, with your majority,
to bowl us over, but you won't gain any
time by it. You may take a horse to the
Grand Committee, but you can't make him
discuss your Bill."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Budget Bill through.</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>It was only a week in the brightest of summers,</p>
<p class="i2">We played tennis and golf, and, when ended the day,</p>
<p>We made furious love as two amateur mummers,</p>
<p class="i2">Whilst Act IV. saw us One in the orthodox way.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>So my holiday ended. I begged a reminder,</p>
<p class="i2">I asked you to send me a portrait that should</p>
<p>Be a sweet recollection, and you, who were kinder</p>
<p class="i2">Than I ever deserved or dared hope, said you would.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Then we parted. Life seemed to be painfully lonely,</p>
<p class="i2">Though I dreamt of a future with you by my side,</p>
<p>Till my common-sense seemed to say, "<i>You</i>, who are only,</p>
<p class="i2">Just a poor needy teacher, have <i>Her</i> for a bride!"</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>It was true, and I knew it. Yet why had I met you?</p>
<p class="i2">Why had Fate kept such bitter-sweet fortune in store?</p>
<p>So determined I set myself then to forget you,</p>
<p class="i2">And to let my thoughts dwell on yourself nevermore.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>First your hair with its gold, next your eyes with their laughter,</p>
<p class="i2">I forgot in a thoroughly workman-like style.</p>
<p>Persevering, I never desisted till after</p>
<p class="i2">Many months I but faintly remembered your smile.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>I completely forgot you (I thought) and the warning</p>
<p class="i2">Was to save me, I chortled, a future of pain,</p>

<p class="i2">And the same old, old trouble starts over again.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>The Fates are a trifle hard, putting it mildly,</p>

  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>I shall treasure it, though. Thanks&mdash;a thousand&mdash;to you, dear.</p>

<h3>POLITICS AND POLITENESS.</h3>

<p><span class="sc">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;I see that the Duke of <span class="sc">Argyll</span>, when he
received the freedom of the Burgh of Paisley, the other day, told the
following interesting story:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"I was going once to call on a lady in London, and when the door was
opened and the servant announced my name, I saw the lady advancing to the
door with a look of absolute consternation on her face. I could not conceive
what had happened, and thought I had entered her room at some inconvenient
moment, but, on looking over her shoulder, I perceived Mr. and
Mrs. <span class="sc">Gladstone</span> sitting at the tea-table, and she evidently thought that
there would be some great explosion when we met. She was greatly
gratified when nothing of the kind occurred, and we enjoyed a cup of tea as
greatly as we had ever done in our lives."
</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, my dear <i>Mr. Punch</i>, I have great sympathy with "the
Lady," and think (with her) the meeting, as described by his Grace
of <span class="sc">Argyll</span>, was mild in the extreme. If something out of the
common had taken place, it would have been far more satisfactory.
To make my meaning plainer, I give roughly (in dramatic form)
what should have happened to have made the action worthy of the
occasion.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>A Drawing-room. Lady entertaining</i> Mr. <i>and</i> Mrs. G.
<i>at tea. A loud knock heard without.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> (<i>greatly agitated</i>). Oh dear, I am sure it is he!</p>

<p><i>Mr. G.</i> (<i>with calm dignity</i>). Do not fear&mdash;if he appears, I shall
know how to deal with him.</p>

<p><i>Lady</i> (<i>pale but calm</i>). Nay, my good, kind friends, believe me, you
shall not suffer from the indiscretion of the servant.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> (<i>pushing her husband into a cupboard</i>). Nay,
<span class="sc">William</span>,
for my sake! And now to conceal myself, so that he may not
suspect his presence by my proximity. [<i>Hides behind the curtains.</i></p>

<p><i>The Duke of Argyll</i> (<i>breaking open the door, and entering
hurriedly</i>). And now, Madam, where is my hated foe? I have
tracked him to this house. It is useless to attempt to conceal him.</p>

<p><i>The Lady</i> (<i>laughing uneasily</i>). Nay, your Grace, you are too
facetious! Trace the <span class="sc">Premier</span> here! Next you will be saying that
he and his good lady were taking tea with me.</p>

<p><i>The Duke</i> (<i>suspiciously</i>). And, no doubt, so they were! This
empty cup, that half-devoured muffin&mdash;to whom do they belong?</p>

<p><i>The Lady</i> (<i>with forced gaiety</i>). Might I not have entertained Mr.
and Mrs. <span class="sc">Joseph Chamberlain</span>, my Lord Duke?</p>

<p><i>The Duke</i> (<i>aside</i>). Can I believe her? (<i>Aloud.</i>) But if it is
as you
say, I will send away my clansmen who throng the street without.
(<i>Opens window and calls.</i>) <i>Gang a waddy Caller Herring!</i> They
will now depart. (<i>A sneeze heard off.</i>) What was that?</p>

<p><i>The Lady</i> (<i>terrified</i>). I fancy it was the wind&mdash;the cold wind&mdash;and
now, believe me, Mr. <span class="sc">Gladstone</span> will abandon Home Rule.</p>

<p><i>Mr. G.</i> (<i>suddenly appearing</i>). Never! I tell you to your face
that you are a traitor! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Sneezes, and hurriedly closes the window.</i></p>

<p><i>The Duke</i> (<i>savagely</i>). That sneeze shall be your last!<span style="float: right">[<i>Takes up a knife lying on the table.</i></span></p>

<p style="margin-top: 2.5em;"><i>Mr. G.</i> (<i>repeating the action</i>). I am ready, Sir!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> (<i>rushing between them</i>). Oh, <span class="sc">William</span>! Do not
fight!</p>

<p><i>The Lady</i> (<i>falling on her knees</i>). I prithee stay!</p>

<p><i>Mr. G.</i> Never! May the better man win!</p>

<p><i>The Duke.</i> So be it!<span style="float: right">[<i>The Scene closes in upon a desperate duel. Curtain.</i></span></p>


<p style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>There, Mr. Punch!</i> What do you think of that? Still, perhaps,
under the circumstances of the case, it is better as it is.</p>

<h3>THE LITIGANT'S VADE MECUM.</h3>

<p><i>Question.</i> Can you tell me the best possible regulations in the
universe?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> Certainly English Common Law.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Is English Common Law accessible to everyone?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Certainly, and if a litigant please, he or she (for sex makes no
difference) can become his or her own advocate.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> When a litigant prefers to conduct a case in person, does the
proceeding invariably save expense?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Not invariably, because a litigant may have odd views about
the importance of evidence and the time of professional advisers.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> When a litigant is afflicted with this lack of knowledge what
is the customary result?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> That the defendants have to undergo the expense of a several-days'
trial with counsel to match.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Supposing that a journalist, sharply but justly, criticises the
actions of a man of straw&mdash;what can the man of straw do?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> With the aid of some speculative Solicitor, he can commence an
action for libel.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What benefit does the speculative Solicitor obtain?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> The speculative Solicitor, if he can persuade a judge and jury
to agree, will get his costs, and if the journalist wins he will find that
the prosecutor or plaintiff is, indeed, a man of straw.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Is there any redress?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> None; but a wise journalist will never criticise sharply.</p>

<h3>THE PICK OF THE R.A. PICTURES. No. 2.</h3>

<p>No. 139. <i>&Ccedil;a donne &agrave; penser.</i> Not a more suggestive pose does
any portrait possess throughout the Galleries. It is described <i>tout
court</i> as "<span class="sc">Albert Brassey</span>, Esq.," and 'tis the work (and the
pleasure) of <span class="sc">W. W. Ouless</span>, R.A. "'Tis a fine work!" says <span class="sc">Bob</span>
to <span class="sc">'Arry</span>. "O' course," returns <span class="sc">'Arry Joker</span>. "Great! <i>'Ow
less</i> could be expected of 'im tho', I dun no." It represents an undecided
moment in Mr. <span class="sc">Albert Brassey's</span> life. It is as if he were Mr. "<i>All
but</i>" <span class="sc">Brassey</span>, and wasn't quite certain of what he should do next.
There is the writing-desk,&mdash;shall he indite a letter? If he does so,
shall he take off his thick-fur coat? Or shall he go hunting, since
he has on, underneath the furrin' fur, the pink of hunting perfection?
Likewise he has his whip and his horn, also his boots! He's
"got 'em on!" He's "got 'em <i>all</i> on!" Or shall he hail the
5,000-ton yacht that's lying in the roads just a few yards from his
open window, and go out for a cruise? He looks happy, but
puzzled.</p>

<p>No. 167. <i>The Right Hon. H. H. Fowler, M.P.</i> "Presentation

Gentleman rose to speak, the House, with the exception of a clerk at
the table and two small boys (whose presence within the precincts
has never been satisfactorily accounted for) was empty."&mdash;<i>Extract
from The Imaginary Times Parliamentary Report of that date.</i></p>

<p>No. 350. <i>Mrs. Keeley at the age of Eighty-six.</i> Looking so well
and sprightly, that the Artist must have been at considerable pains
to induce her to sit still just one moment for
her portrait. Long may she remain with us!
Our compliments to the Artist, <span class="sc">Julia B.
Folkard.</span></p>

<p>No. 434. Mr. <span class="sc">Somerscales</span> has given us the
best sea-piece of the year. It shows a "<i>Corvette
shortening sail to pick up a shipwrecked crew</i>."
"A sale in sight appeared!"&mdash;and as the
picture, so it is said, was immediately sold, so
also were those who came too late to make a
bid.</p>

<p>No. 524. <i>Gentleman writing.</i> "A nice quiet
corner for a little composition away from all
those speaking likenesses." <span class="sc">J. W. Forster.</span></p>

<p>No. 533. This is a sad-looking little girl,
painted by <span class="sc">William Carter</span>. She has an
unsettled expression. Is she suffering from
what the Clown calls "teezy-weezies-in-the-pandenoodles,"
and, as Sir <span class="sc">John Millais's</span>
"<i>Bubbles</i>" served <span class="sc">P**rs</span> for an advertisement,
is it beyond the range of probability
that this, being associated with the name of
"<span class="sc">Carter</span>," should be intended as a pictorial
advertisement for the well-known "L-ttle
L-v-r P-lls"?</p>

<p>No. 535. Portrait (presumably) of <i>C. R.
Fletcher Lutwidge, Esq.</i> By <span class="sc">St. George
Hare</span>. Ha! Ha! Ha! By St. George you Ha're bound to laugh
directly you look at it. You can't help it. "C. R. F. L." is
chuckling to himself and saying, "Ha! Ha! I've just thought
of <i>such</i> a funny thing! Ha! Ha! Ha!" And he <i>is</i> enjoying it
so! As the song says, "O Mister (I forget the name), what a funny
little man you are!"</p>

<p>No. 553. This, by Mr. <span class="sc">Markham Skipworth</span>, is a portrait of
<i>Dr. E. Ker Gray, LL.D</i> of St. George's Chapel, Mayfair. "<span class="sc">Ker
Gray</span>!" it ought to be "Ker Scarlet."</p>

<p>No. 862. <i>Portrait of a Gentleman</i>, by <span class="sc">Phil R. Morris</span>, A. The
Portrait, annoyed at being next to <span class="sc">Sidney Cooper's</span>, R A., "<i>Be it
ever so humble, &amp;c.</i>," representing head of a jackass, and some
sheepish sheep, is evidently saying to itself, "Hang the Hanging
Committee! They show me as next door to a donkey."</p>

<p>No. 888. <i>The Wedding Gifts.</i> The pretty Bride is a bit
frightened at seeing the Groom leading up two bare-back'd steeds.
"Oh!" she cries, "I can't ride <i>them</i>! Why (<i>to her husband</i>) did
you give me these?" "My dear," says he, "why not? Here
are the bare-backed steeds, and you've already got the Ring."
<span class="sc">S. E. Waller</span>.</p>

<p>No. 892. "<i>Your Health!</i>" A Birthday Party at Mr. <span class="sc">Ernest
Hart's</span>. Painted by <span class="sc">S. J. Solomon</span>. As a subject, the wisdom of
<span class="sc">Solomon</span> is questionable as a specimen of Hacademie Hart&mdash;ahem!
However, to the toast of "<i>Your Health</i>!" as addressed to
Mr. <span class="sc">Ernest Hart</span>, Master <span class="sc">Sol</span> might have
added the words, "<i>Most Ernestly and
Hartily</i>."</p>

<p>No. 928. <i>Exhibition of Miss Biffin</i>, "who
has no legs to speak of." "If you saw my
ancles," said <i>Miss Mowcher</i>, "I should go
home and kill myself." But <span class="sc">Arthur Hacker</span>,
whose capital work it is, calls it "<i>Circe</i>."</p>

<p>No. 937. "<i>It might have been</i>," by F.
<span class="sc">Stuart Sindici</span>, represents <span class="sc">Napoleon</span> and
<span class="sc">Wellington</span> out walking together, in 1847,
near the Horse Guards. "It might have
been" <i>if</i> .... But it wasn't&mdash;though F.
<span class="sc">Stuart Sindici</span> went nap on it, and dreamt
it. Why shouldn't <span class="sc">Julius C&aelig;sar</span> and Lord
<span class="sc">Brougham</span> have hobnobbed together over
Pommery '74 at <span class="sc">Frascati's</span> in Regent Street,
or why shouldn't the Great Duke of <span class="sc">Marlborough</span>
and Admiral <span class="sc">Hamilcar</span> of Carthage,
after leaving <i>Hoi Adelphoi</i> at the theatre,
have taken supper at <span class="sc">Rule's</span> in Maiden Lane?
Why not? "It might have been"&mdash;of
course; why, when you come to think of it,
there's hardly anything that mightn't have
been, <i>if</i> it had only taken place. Such possible
subjects would fill the most vast picture gallery
in the <i>Ch&acirc;teau d'If</i>.</p>

<h3>TO MY UMBRELLA.</h3>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Good, faithful friend, it seems an age</p>
<p class="i2">Since last we met and walked together!</p>
<p>Upon the <i>Daily Graphic's</i> page</p>
<p class="i2">For weeks I've watched the coming weather;</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>The meteorologic girl,</p>
<p class="i2">Despite cold arms, seemed almost jolly,</p>
<p>And made no effort to unfurl</p>
<p class="i2">That wonderful archaic brolly.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>So I, grown reckless, did as she.</p>
<p class="i2">And gave you quite a Long Vacation;</p>
<p>Such weather cannot always be,</p>
<p class="i2">Or you would lose your occupation.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Think how I've treated you! A pet</p>
<p class="i2">Might envy all the care I gave you;</p>
<p>When worn-out with work and wet,</p>
<p class="i2">Think how I did my best to save you!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>You soon looked well, and eased my fears&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">Recovered after over-pressure.</p>
<p>When you "took silk" in other years,</p>
<p class="i2">Think what I paid for each "refresher"!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>When last it rained I had to roll</p>
<p class="i2">You up quite wet; you've been forgotten.</p>
<p>It rains once more. What's this? A hole?</p>
<p class="i2">By Jove, the silk's completely rotten!</p>

<h3>ON THE INCOME-TAX.</h3>

<blockquote><p class="center">[By an already over-burdened tax-payer who
derived neither enlightenment nor comfort from

between Mr. <span class="sc">Bartley</span> and Sir <span class="sc">William Harcourt</span>.]</p></blockquote>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Graduation" seems vexation,</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">That's Swear It Is!</span>"&mdash;In bygone
days, when the Princess's was under the
management of Mr. and Mrs. <span class="sc">Charles Kean</span>,
there was a fine imposed on any member of
the company who should make use of bad
language in the Green-Room. One evening
a distinguished actor so far forgot himself as
to let slip an expletive of three simple letters,
whereat Mrs. <span class="sc">Kean</span> held up her hands
in horror and quitted the room, followed by
the actresses who happened to be present.
Subsequently some wag at the Garrick Club
wrote a song whereof the burden was "The
Man who said 'dam' in the Green-Room."
<i>Tempora mutantur</i>, and now, at the Avenue
Theatre, under the management of Mr. and
Mrs. <span class="sc">Kendal</span> in the Green-Room and behind
the scenes, as well as on the stage, "<span class="sc">Dam</span>"
will be in everyone's mouth, as this happens
to be the name of the Author of their latest
successful production.</p>
